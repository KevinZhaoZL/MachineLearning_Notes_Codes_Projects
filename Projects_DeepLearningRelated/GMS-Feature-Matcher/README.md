## Other Resouces

  The method has been integrated into OpenCV library (see xfeatures2d in [opencv_contrib](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib)).

  The paper was selected and reviewed by [Computer Vision News](http://www.rsipvision.com/ComputerVisionNews-2017August/#48).

  More experiments are shown in [FM-Bench](https://jwbian.net/fm-bench).
	
## Usage

Requirement:

	1.OpenCV 3.0 or later (for IO and ORB features, necessary)

	2.cudafeatures2d module(for gpu nearest neighbor, optional)

C++ Example:

	Image pair demo in demo.cpp.
	
Matlab Example
	
	You should compile the code with opencv library firstly(see the 'Compile.m').

Python Example:
	
	Use Python3 to run gms_matcher script.
	
Tune Parameters:

	In demo.cpp
		1.	#define USE_GPU" (need cudafeatures2d module) 
				using cpu mode by commenting it.
				
		2.	For high-resolution images, we suggest using 100K features with setFastThreshod(5);
		
		3.	For low-resolution (like VGA) images, we suggest using 10K features with setFastThreshod(0);
	
	In gms_matcher.h
				
		2.	#define THRESH_FACTOR 6			
				The higher, the less matchesã€‚
				
		3. 	int GetInlierMask(vector<bool> &vbInliers, bool WithScale = false, bool WithRotation = false)
				Set WithScale to be true for unordered image matching and false for video matching.
